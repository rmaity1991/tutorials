    "What is Linked List? \n",
    "Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. They include a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Linked Lists:\n",
    "Simple Linked List – In this type of linked list, one can move or traverse the linked list in only one direction\n",
    "Doubly Linked List – In this type of linked list, one can move or traverse the linked list in both directions (Forward and Backward)\n",
    "Circular Linked List – In this type of linked list, the last node of the linked list contains the link of the first/head node of the linked list in its next pointer and the first/head node contains the link of the last node of the linked list in its prev pointer\n"
