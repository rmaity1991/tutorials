/*
C++ Array of Pointers
Array and pointers are closely related to each other. In C++, the name of an array is considered Ã s a pointer, i.e., 
the name of an array contains the address of an element. C++ considers the array name as the address of the first element. 
For example, if we create an array, i.e., marks which hold the 20 values of integer type, then marks will contain the address of first element, 
i.e., marks[0]. Therefore, we can say that array name (marks) is a pointer which is holding the address of the first element of an array.
