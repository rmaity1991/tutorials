/*
C++ identifiers in a program are used to refer to the name of the variables, functions, arrays, or 
other user-defined data types created by the programmer. They are the basic requirement of any language. 
Every language has its own rules for naming the identifiers.

In short, we can say that the C++ identifiers represent the essential elements in a program which are given below:

Constants
Variables
Functions
Labels
Defined data types
