/*
C++ Destructor
A destructor works opposite to constructor; it destructs the objects of classes. It can be defined only once in a class. 
Like constructors, it is invoked automatically.

A destructor is defined like constructor. It must have same name as class. But it is prefixed with a tilde sign (~).
