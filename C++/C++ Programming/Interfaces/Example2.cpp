Data Abstraction in C++
Data Abstraction is a process of providing only the essential details to the outside world and hiding the internal details, i.e., 
representing only the essential details in the program.
Data Abstraction is a programming technique that depends on the seperation of the interface and implementation details of the program.
Let's take a real life example of AC, which can be turned ON or OFF, change the temperature, change the mode, and other external components 
such as fan, swing. But, we don't know the internal details of the AC, i.e., how it works internally. Thus, we can say that AC seperates the 
implementation details from the external interface.
C++ provides a great level of abstraction. For example, pow() function is used to calculate the power of a number without knowing the algorithm 
the function follows.
In C++ program if we implement class with private and public members then it is an example of data abstraction.

Data Abstraction can be achieved in two ways:

Abstraction using classes
Abstraction in header files.

Abstraction using classes: An abstraction can be achieved using classes. A class is used to group all the data members and member functions 
into a single unit by using the access specifiers. A class has the responsibility to determine which data member is to be visible outside and which is not.

Abstraction in header files: An another type of abstraction is header file. For example, pow() function available is used to calculate the 
power of a number without actually knowing which algorithm function uses to calculate the power. Thus, we can say that header files hides 
all the implementation details from the user.

Access Specifiers Implement Abstraction:

Public specifier: When the members are declared as public, members can be accessed anywhere from the program.
Private specifier: When the members are declared as private, members can only be accessed only by the member functions of the class.
